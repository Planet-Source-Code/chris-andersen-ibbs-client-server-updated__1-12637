## iBBS client/server \(Updated\!\)


</div>

### Description

This is an update to my TCP/IP client and server that allows multi user chat, file downloading, and instant message. I did some more clean up and fixed the bugs I was having with IM. Also added some file extension recognition to the file list that changes the icon for the file depending on its extension. Please read the readme for more info.
